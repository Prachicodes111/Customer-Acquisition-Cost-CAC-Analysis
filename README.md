# Customer-Acquisition-Cost-CAC-Analysis

## Overview
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) refers to the cost a business incurs to acquire a new customer. This project demonstrates how to analyze CAC using Python, providing insights into the efficiency of various marketing channels. The analysis is essential for businesses to understand the cost-effectiveness of their marketing efforts, optimize their strategies, and ultimately, improve profitability.

This project leverages a dataset of customer acquisition expenses and uses Python libraries like pandas and plotly to perform calculations, visualize insights, and evaluate the performance of different marketing channels.

## Process
- Data Collection: Import a dataset containing customer acquisition expenses across multiple marketing channels.
- CAC Calculation: Calculate the Customer Acquisition Cost for each marketing channel by dividing marketing spend by the number of new customers acquired.
- Visualization: Create visualizations to explore CAC by marketing channel, new customers vs. CAC, conversion rates, and break-even customers.
- Statistical Summary: Generate summary statistics to assess the performance of each marketing channel.
- Optimization: Analyze the results to suggest improvements and optimizations for customer acquisition efforts.

## Key Insights
- Highest CAC: Email Marketing has the highest customer acquisition cost. This means the company spends more on average to acquire customers through this channel.
- Lowest CAC: Social Media shows the lowest customer acquisition cost, indicating that this channel is the most efficient at acquiring new customers.
- CAC Trends: A negative correlation exists between the number of new customers acquired and CAC. Channels with higher new customers tend to have lower CAC.
- Conversion Rate: Online Ads have the highest conversion rate among all channels, meaning they are more efficient at turning marketing spend into new customers.
- Break-Even Analysis: Across all channels, the actual number of customers acquired matches or exceeds the break-even customers, indicating a positive outcome for the companyâ€™s marketing campaign.
- Channel Efficiency: Focusing on channels like Social Media and Referral may help in reducing overall customer acquisition costs while maintaining high conversion rates.
